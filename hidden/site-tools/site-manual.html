        <h2>Prorities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Speed</li>
            <li>Simplicity</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Speed</h2>

        <p>The entirety of the site is to be contructed using methods that reduce the file transfer speed while allowing for fast load times.

Some of the features included to achieve this goal includes:
        <ul>
        <li>HTML Element generation via javascript</li>
        <li>Reductions in file sizes especially images</li>
        <li>Writing minimalist code</li>
        <li>Utilizing functions whenever code has to repeat to reduce bloat</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Simplicity</h2>

        <p>Code should be simple to understand and if it crosses any thresholder of complexity it should be rewritten or accompanied by simple documentation.

Any and all of the scripts should have ample comments if required.
Scripts should have their placement be sensible and localize instead of centralized.
All elements and code should have a functioning purpose and not be redundant.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Recap</h2>

        <p> All of these rules are more of guidelines, any conflict in decision making should refer to these guidelines</p>
